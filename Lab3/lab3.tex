\section{Lab 3 - Adders, Subtractors, and Multipliers}

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsection{Lab Activities}

\subsubsection{Half Adder}
Build the following Half adder circuit

\subsubsection{Full Adder / Subtractor}
Expand on the half adder to create a full 8 bit carry adder. How would you implement a subtractor?

\subsubsection{Multiplier}
Follow this multiplier circuit.........


%HEX0 - HEX1 - Set by SW0-7

%HEX2- HEX3 -  Set by SW8-15

%FF + FF = 1FE

%HEX4 - HEX5 = SUM

%LEDG = Overflow/carry_out

%carry_in 


%CLOCK -  KEY[0]
