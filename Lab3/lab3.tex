\section{Lab 3 - Complex Addition/Subtraction Systems}

\subsection{Introduction}
From your pocket calculator to inside modern CPUs adders have long been used as more than just a simple way to sum numbers together. This lab will go into the logic structure of the adder as well as provide a method for converting the simple full adder in to an \emph{arithmetic logic unit} (ALU) capable of handling 12 instructions.

\subsection{Lab Activities}

\subsubsection{Half Adder}
Build the circuit in Figure ??, create a test bench and verify that the logic is correct.


\subsubsection{Full Adder / Subtractor}
Expand on the half adder to create a full 8 bit carry adder. How would you implement a subtractor?


%HEX0 - HEX1 - Set by SW0-7

%HEX2- HEX3 -  Set by SW8-15

%FF + FF = 1FE

%HEX4 - HEX5 = SUM

%LEDG = Overflow/carry_out

%carry_in 


%CLOCK -  KEY[0]
